# OPTimization_C
C library with optimization algorithms I've developed throughout my studies

# Compile the code
In the terminal, access the directory of the optimizer type you wish to run:
```
cd <optimizer_type>
```

Then, compile the algorithm file with the main function:
```
g++ -o <executable_name> <algorithm_call_file>.c ./src/<optimizer_type>.c
```

Lastly, run the executable file:
```
./<executable_name>
```
